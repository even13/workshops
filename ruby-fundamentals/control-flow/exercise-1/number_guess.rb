# Write a program that asks a user to guess a chosen
# number. It should:
# * Randomly choose a number between 1 and 10
# * Ask the user to guess a number
# * If the user guesses the correct number the program
# should output a message that says "you guessed correctly"
# * If the user guesses incorrectly the program should
# output "higher" if the guess was less than the chosen
# number or "lower" if the guess was more than the chosen
# number
