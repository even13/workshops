# Code quality discussion

## Structure

There are three questions below.  For each one:

* Break out into small groups of around four.

* Spend five minutes discussing the question.

* Write down the main points you discussion.

* We'll gather back into one group and each group will report their thoughts.

### Questions

#### The process you use to write code

* E.g. test-first development.

#### Desirable qualities of code

* E.g. code being easy to understand.

#### Guidelines for writing better code
