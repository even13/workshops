# Process Rubric

## Developer
Before you start work, remember to set yourself a 
[learning goal](https://diode.makersacademy.com/students/dearshrewdwit/projects/4692).

You are responsible for three things.

#### During the observation
1. Writing code - the programming. Focus on demonstrating a process you want to improve.

2. Indicating what stage of your process you're at using the process cards.

#### After the observation
3. Using the recording and feedback to improve your process. If you're unsure of how to do this - find a coach.

## Observer

You are responsible for timing the session and recording feedback in 3 ways.

#### 1. When the developer flails
-  Record the timestamp of `flails`* - use your timer to note the time.

#### 2. Is their process clear?
- Record if the developer indicates what stage of their process they're at throughout the session.
  - Did it stop at some point?
  - Did one stage last most of the session?
  - Were there lots of stage jumps?

#### 3. Record other feedback you notice
