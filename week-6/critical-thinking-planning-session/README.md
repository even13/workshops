# Thinking critically about planning sessions

## Learning objectives

- I can list the goals of a planning session
- I can describe how to run an ideal planning session
- I can explain how planning sessions fit into the philosophy of continuous improvement

## Introduction

Why is planning important?

There are two meanings to this question - first, why is important to plan our work well; secondly, why is it important that we run our planning sessions well?

The first should feel fairly clear. Without some kind of plan or definition of success, we can't effectively deliver.

The second is an area that many teams struggle with. Planning feels secondary to development; we're trained to write code, not run planning sessions.

But the best teams communicate well and empower the individuals within the team. Planning sessions, standups, retros - any time the team comes together - are key elements in achieving a happy, productive team. We need to think critically about them, not just do them because they are 'agile' things to do, but think about what we're trying to achieve and refine them so that we get the outcomes we desire.

### Goals of a planning session

- Develop a shared understanding of the work
- Define sprint goals
- Estimate work to be done
- Refine sprint goals

### Artefacts of a planning session

- Whiteboard diagram
- Defined tasks in a visible workflow

## How to write a ticket
Task definitions can be written in a number of ways. One possible format is:

- User Story
- Scope
- Acceptance criteria

See the

### User story
Describes the feature that you're trying to build. For example:

```
As a user
So that I can share pictures with my friends
I can upload a photo via a web form
```

### Scope
Describes the scope of the work to be done as part of the task. For example, in the above use story, there may be two bits of work to be done - building a form to which the photo is uploaded and building an API to which the uploaded photo is sent on the server. These may be split into two separate tasks, with the scope of one task being `'Front end'` and the second being `'API and file storage'`.

### Acceptance criteria
Describes a series of objective tests that can be used to accept when the work is finished. This is not the same as a user story; they are usually more specific and may include edge or error cases.

There are various formats that these can be written in, one useful format is 'given, then, when'. For example:

```
Given that I have logged in
When I click on the 'upload' link in the menu bar
Then I see a form for uploading pictures

Given that I am on the upload picture page
When I drag an image file into the upload box
Then the image file is uploaded to the server
```

## Exercise (30 minutes)

Observe the planning session. Think about:
- What was effective about the session? Did it achieve it's goals?
- What could the session have been more effective?
- Was there anything that surprised you about the session?

At the end of the observation, take 10 minutes to write a short paragraph on how you think an ideal planning session should be run. We will gather back and share some of these in the plenary.

## Plenary

Discuss the planning session that you observed, identifying any areas for improvement.
