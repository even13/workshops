# Estimating tickets

## Instructions

### Learning objectives

* Describe a card wall as a tool to distribute and prioritise work in a team.
* Analyse a requested feature to break it down into manageable chunks of work.
* Estimate the amount of time a chunk of work will take.

### Estimating the time it will take to complete a ticket (15 minutes)

We'll do this as a group, starting with the tickets you completed on Monday.

Go back over the all the tickets on the board, and think about how long it took you to complete. Give it a rating of "1" if it took you a couple of hours, "2" if it took you half a day, and "3" if it took you a whole day.

Then have a look at the remaining tickets on the board and think about the components of that chunk of work. How many classes do you think you will need to build? Is it similar to any piece of work you have done before? Is there any part of this ticket that will take research before you know how long it will take?

### Breaking down features into distributable chunks of work (30 minutes)

* In groups, analyse a feature by thinking about all the constituent parts.
* For each of those constituent parts, repeat the process to try and tease out another, simpler layer.
* Ask "Is there any part of this that could be pulled out as a self-contained piece of work".
* When you think you are done, discuss it and estimate it as a group.
* If you estimate higher than a "3", it is still too big - revisit your approach and see if you can break it down in a different way.
* If you do not have enough information to estimate the ticket, move it to "Needs research" column.
* Once the ticket is estimated, move it to the 'To do' column.

### Plenary (15 mins)

We'll come back together for a short plenary, and review our board before we start working on tickets.
