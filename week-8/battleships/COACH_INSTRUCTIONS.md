The point of this workshop, at a high level, is:

> Working with legacy code involves discovery and archaeology. By the end of the workshop, you'll be equipped to dive into a legacy codebase, understand how it works, and share your findings through documentation.

Outcomes:

- State the easiest way to get insight into a legacy application is through documenting it ('archaeology').
- Explain how to use writing documentation to get insight into how an app works.
- Do archaeology on a Rails app, adding some documentation.

Sneaky outcomes:

- "Even if I can't contribute technically, I can contribute documentation"
- "This is what Makers mean by 'professional skills are inseparable from technical skills'"

## Starter

1. Facilitate a diagram of Rails, finding the most important bits.
2. Explain that 'documentation is first-class code'. Give good examples (Written docs in Hub, Process diagram in Hub and Entity-Relationship diagram in Hub)

## Main

Take [this app](https://github.com/makersacademy/debugging-rails). Add one or more documentation commits to it. This could be:

- Documentation of a single object's interface
- Documentation of how multiple objects interact
- Documentation of how to set up and run the project
- Some other documentation
- For an added challenge, try adding some docs using [RDoc](https://ruby.github.io/rdoc/)

## Plenary

Discuss the experience and share examples.
