Refactoring with OO 1
=====================

## Learn to

* Identify poor quality code
* Consider possible refactors using OO relationships
* Implement refactors using OO relationships

## Exercise 1

Your coach will take you through `example_1` in this repository:

https://github.com/neoeno/student_directory_refactoring_exercise

They will analyse the codebase for quality, identify some possible refactors, and then perform one on the board.

After this, you will perform the refactor yourself.

We will repeat this cycle a few times with increasingly sophisticated refactors.

## Exercise 2

Analyse and refactor `example_2` in the repository above.
