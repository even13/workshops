# Practicals

Each practical is designed to train a skill.

They are, as per the name, practical exercises rather than tutorials or reference material. They require work and time.

You may wish use these to:

* Learn a new skill
* Practice a skill that feels rusty.
* Identify skills in need of work.

At Makers many of these are delivered as workshops, but you should feel free to tackle them independently.

## Feedback

**Consider how you will get feedback on whether you are applying the skill correctly.**

This might be asking a coach, another developer, or from some technical tool. It's important that it comes from somewhere, though.

You will know your feedback strategy isn't functioning adequately if you're worrying about things like "have I done this right?"

That's your brain giving you feedback that you're not getting enough feedback :)

## Formatting

Many of these use extended Markdown features, for instance diagrams, that won't appear on Github.

Paste them into a document on [HackMD](http://hackmd.io/) to use them.
