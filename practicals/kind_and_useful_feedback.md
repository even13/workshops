Kind and Useful Feedback
========================

Remember learning basic Ruby syntax? Maybe you wrote something like this:

```ruby
numbers = [1 2 3]
```

And saw:

```
SyntaxError: (irb):6: syntax error, unexpected tINTEGER, expecting ']'
numbers = [1 2 3]
              ^
	from /Users/kay/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.4.0/bin/irb:11:in `<main>'
```

Sure, it didn't solve your problem, but it helped an awful lot. Most developers learn basic syntax pretty quickly, and a lot of this is because of the high quality feedback you get from the ruby interpreter.

We can use feedback to help us with other skills too:

* Code review helps us improve our code quality
* Observation helps us improve our process of writing code
* Social feedback helps us improve our teamwork skills

We're going to focus on how feedback from other humans can help us.

## Exercise 1

Watch two coaches give eachother feedback. As they talk to eachother, pick out the feedback they give and put it on a graph like this:

```
                  Useful
                    ^
                    |
                    |
                    |
                    |
                    |
Unkind <------------+------------> Kind
                    |            
                    |
                    |
                    |
                    |
                    v
                Not useful
```

Don't think too much about the definitions for now, just whatever feels intuitive.

## Exercise 2

List some characteristics of the 'useful' items:

List some characteristics of the 'kind' items:

## Exercise 3

Join your pair with another pair. Decide who is Pair A and who is pair B.

Pair A: Give each other feedback on your pairing experience today, keeping 'usefulness' and 'kindness' in mind.

Pair B: Observe and take notes on the usefulness and kindness of Pair A's feedback.

Do this for 10 minutes, then swap so that Pair A is observing and Pair B is giving each other feedback.

## Exercise 4

Share your observations of each other's feedback as a group

Still keep in mind 'usefulness' and 'kindness'.

Do this for 10 minutes.
