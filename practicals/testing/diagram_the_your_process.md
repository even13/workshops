# Diagram Your TDD Process

## Action Plan

**Build a decision tree (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree) for the TDD Cycle.**

* It should accept a User Story as an input. It should output a Feature.

* It should include the following levels:
  - Feature Test
  - Unit Test
  - Implementation
  - It should include Refactoring.

## Getting feedback
Try the decision tree out live. Does it work? Do you end up systematically following the Red-Green-Refactor cycle?
Give it to someone else. When they follow it without interpreting it too much, do they end up doing the TDD Cycle?
Show and explain your decision tree to a coach. Do they agree it's accurate?
