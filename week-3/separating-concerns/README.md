## Separation of Concerns

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `bundle` to install dependencies
3. Run `rake setup` to set up databases
4. Refactor the application to feature better separation of concerns - you will likely need to write new tests for your model layer.
5. All existing tests should still pass!
